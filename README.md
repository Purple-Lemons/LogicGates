# LogicGates
An A Level project that allows users to create logic circuits, written in Java.

This program allows users to build logic circuits out of the 7 logic gates, on/off switches and lights 
indicating the output state of the system. It then computes the truth table for this circuit and 
outputs it below the circuit. There is also functionality to save and load circuits.
